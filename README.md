# story_reader

Read posts from Facebook and store them in the database.

Clone this repository or copy the files into a directory:
https://github.com/facinghomelessness/story_reader

Copy the file config_template.py to config.py and fill in the required values
for the system this will run on, for the Facebook page, and for the SQL Server
database.

Then run facebook_posts.py under Python 2.7.

Eventually this will run as a Scheduler job on Azure.
